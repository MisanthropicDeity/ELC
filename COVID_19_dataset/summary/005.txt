 Coronavirus: Inside test-and-trace - how the 'world beater' went wrong. Just half of close contacts given to England's NHS Test and Trace are being reached in some areas, a BBC investigation has found. Further revelations include the fact that a move to more local contact tracing by councils was being undermined by IT problems, leading to a reliance on spreadsheets and delays getting contact details. The name NHS Test and Trace sounds like it is one whole service that is part of the NHS. Private firms play a key role in terms of both testing and tracing, which has meant some of the local expertise available in the NHS, universities and councils has been bypassed.
