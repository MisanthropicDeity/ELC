Coronavirus: How to stay cool in a face mask as hot UK weather forecast.
 You don't really need the TV weather maps turning red to realise that much of the UK is going to be roasting in temperatures above 30C. "We have all got to wear masks here, but there's a few things you can do," says consultant dermatologist Dr Adil Sheraz, who works at a London NHS hospital. So I don't think I'd advise that." Dr Anil Budh-Raja, a GP who also offers skin and cosmetic treatments at clinics in Birmingham and Chiswick, suggested a towel which has been put in the freezer could be used as a mask. Remember that public towel slips are always embarrassing in the summer heat.
