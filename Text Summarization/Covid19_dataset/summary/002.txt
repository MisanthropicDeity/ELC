World Health Assembly charts course for COVID-19 response and global health priorities.
As health leaders prepare to gather for a virtual session of the resumed 73rd World Health Assembly (WHA), WHO has three messages to share. First, we can beat COVID-19 with science, solutions and solidarity. Although this is a global crisis, many countries and cities have successfully prevented or controlled transmission with a comprehensive, evidence-based approach. Second, we must not backslide on our critical health goals. Since May, Member States have adopted a number of decisions – the Immunization Agenda 2030, the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020-2030, as well as initiatives to tackle cervical cancer, tuberculosis, eye care, food safety, intellectual property and influenza preparedness. Third, we must prepare for the next pandemic now. he WHA will consider a draft resolution (EB146.R10) that strengthens Member States’ preparedness for health emergencies, such as COVID-19, through more robust compliance with the International Health Regulations (2005).
