'Vaccines for all', and Patel 'bullying' row. 
Both the Guardian and the Times compare Boris Johnson's refusal to sack Priti Patel to his defence of Dominic Cummings's trip to Barnard Castle during the first lockdown. For the Times, the prime minister has again expended political capital by standing by a wounded colleague whom he may yet have to dismiss if further damaging details emerge. According to the Guardian, No 10's determination to "brazen out" the row is another sign that Mr Johnson sees following the rules as unnecessary for "his gang". But Ms Patel's job requires passion - and not "haughty Sir Humphreys deploying every trick to impede demanding, but popular, policies". A number of front pages celebrate the prospect of what the i weekend bills as "Vaccines for all by Easter". So it is "Covid-19 Jabs For All By Spring" in the Daily Express, and "Virus Jabs For All By April" in the Daily Mirror. A leaked timetable has revealed that care home residents and staff, health workers, and people over 80 could get the Pfizer jab, if it is approved, next month. A Whitehall source tells the Mail the move could "make a huge difference" to the aviation and travel industries.
