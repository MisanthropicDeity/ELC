Coronavirus: Global Covid-19 death toll passes one million.
 The tally by Johns Hopkins University shows that deaths in the US, Brazil and India make up nearly half that total. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called it a "mind-numbing" figure and "an agonising milestone". The development comes nearly 10 months after news of the coronavirus began to emerge from Wuhan, China. The pandemic has since spread to 188 countries with more than 32 million confirmed cases. Meanwhile, efforts to develop an effective vaccine are continuing - although the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the death toll could hit two million before one is widely available.
