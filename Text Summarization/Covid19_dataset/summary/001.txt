Success from two leading coronavirus vaccine programs likely means other frontrunners will also show strong protection against COVID-19, Bill Gates said Tuesday.
The fact that two coronavirus vaccines recently showed strong protection against COVID-19 bodes well for other leading programs led by AstraZeneca, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson, Bill Gates said Tuesday.The billionaire Microsoft founder and philanthropist said it will be easier to boost manufacturing and distribute these other shots to the entire world, particularly developing nations.The vaccine space has seen a flurry of good news in recent days, marked by overwhelming success in late-stage trials by both Pfizer and Moderna. "With the very good news from Pfizer and Moderna, we think it's now likely that AstraZeneca, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson will also likely show very strong efficacy," Gates told journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
