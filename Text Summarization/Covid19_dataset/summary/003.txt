Ensuring Cambodia has supplies and access to COVID-19 tools.
“As long as the virus continues to circulate anywhere, no country and no one is safe, including in Cambodia,” said Dr. Li. “We must continue to detect, test, isolate and care for patients, and trace and quarantine their contacts—and to do this we must have sufficient diagnostics, PPE, and medical equipment.” Beyond procuring supplies, WHO and the UN system are also strengthening the global supply chain. On 24 April, WHO launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which is a global collaboration to accelerate development, production and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. In addition to accelerating research and ensuring manufacturing capacity for COVID-19 vaccines, WHO has supported the Royal Government of Cambodia to strengthen its regulatory capacity, draft a COVID-19 National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) and assess immunization supply chain management.
