New Zealand takes early and hard action to tackle COVID-19.

Three days after WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, New Zealand began introducing disease prevention measures and continued strengthening them in the weeks that followed. “So New Zealand took a precautionary approach and on 26 March, apart from essential workers, the entire country was required to self-quarantine at home.” WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, Dr Takeshi Kasai, explains that New Zealand combined strict physical distancing with strong testing, contact tracing, clinical management of those infected, and clear and regular public communication. Concerned that COVID-19 could be transmitted through New Zealand to Pacific island countries – which are some of the only places still free of COVID-19 – the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade worked closely with WHO to support their neighbours in the Pacific.
